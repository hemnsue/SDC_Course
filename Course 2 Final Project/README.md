# In Course 2 I learnt about

* The importance of localization for autonomous systems.
* In-depth mathematics behind state estimation techniques via sensor fusion using Error-State Kalman Filter, Extended Kalman Filter, and the basic Kalman Filter.
* A thorough introduction to quaternions and their use in handling 3D rotations for maintaining orientation, which is crucial in state estimation for self-driving cars.
* The integration of IMU with LiDAR and GNSS for accurate sensor fusion, and the overall importance of sensor fusion.
* How LiDAR sensors work, their role in perception, and the impact of sensor failures on system performance.
* The critical importance of sensor calibration for maintaining the reliability and accuracy of self-driving vehicles.
